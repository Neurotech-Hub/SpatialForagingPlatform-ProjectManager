# Architecture

Captures the integrated system architecture for the platform.

## System overview

The Spatial Foraging Platform is a modular, network-connected behavioral apparatus
consisting of a Raspberry Pi 5 base station and up to N foraging modules (reference
deployment: 9 modules) connected over a CAN bus in a linear daisy-chain. Each
foraging module is an independent unit housing an ESP32S3, two stepper-motor pellet
dispensers, a beam-break and capacitive-touch sensing suite, and status LEDs. The base
station orchestrates node discovery, session management, event logging, and
synchronization with external recording systems via BNC I/O. All modules are powered
from a single 12 V supply routed through the daisy-chain; the base station is powered
separately via USB-C.

## Communication protocol

CAN bus was selected as the module network protocol for the following reasons:

- **Noise immunity** — differential signalling is robust over the cable lengths
typical in a home-cage arena.
- **Bus topology** — all nodes share a single cable run; individual node wiring is
minimised.
- **Built-in error handling** — CAN hardware provides automatic retransmission, error
frames, and bus-off detection without requiring application-layer redundancy.
- **Peer-to-peer broadcasting** — any node can broadcast events to all other nodes and
to the base station simultaneously.

## CAN bus topology

### Physical topology

Linear bus topology. RJ45/Ethernet connectors carry CAN signals (CAN_H, CAN_L),
12 V power, GND, and addressing GPIOs (AEO/AEI) in a daisy-chain from the base
station through every module.

### Termination

CAN requires a 120 Ω termination resistor at each end of the bus.


| End          | Termination method                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Base station | Fixed 120 Ω resistor on the CAN HAT |
| Last node    | Automatic via hardware logic        |


The automatic termination on the last node works as follows: when the node's CAN-out
RJ45 port is **unplugged**, hardware logic (a physical switch or pull) asserts the
termination resistor. When the port is plugged in and continues the chain, termination
is disabled. No firmware intervention is required.

### Addressing and discovery

Each node's UUID is its ESP32S3 MAC address. The base station assigns a logical Node ID
(1-based integer) during discovery and stores the UUID↔ID mapping in its registry.
Each node stores its assigned ID in ESP32S3 NVS (non-volatile storage) so it persists
across power cycles.

Discovery uses a daisy-chain Address Enable signal. Each module has:

- **AEO** — Address Enable Out (drives the next node's AEI).
- **AEI** — Address Enable In (gates whether the node participates in the current
discovery step).

#### First boot — all nodes have empty NVS

#### Node ID organisation

After discovery, the user maps logical Node IDs to physical positions (arena layout).
Both the base station registry and each node's NVS stay in sync; a node that loses its
NVS falls back to first-boot behaviour on the next power cycle.

### CAN identifier layout

VFM uses **11-bit standard CAN identifiers** (`0x000`–`0x7FF`, 2048 IDs) with software
filtering. The identifier carries **message class and target node** only; opcodes, event
types, and payload (dispense state, pellet counts, etc.) live in the separate 0–8 byte
data field.

Operational messages use `identifier = BASE + nodeId`. The **low 8 bits** are `nodeId`
(0–255); the **upper bits** select message class (`0x1xx` commands, `0x2xx` heartbeat,
`0x3xx` events). Node IDs are 1-based; `nodeId == 0` on commands means broadcast
(`0x100`).


| Region           | Range           | Role                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Discovery        | `0x080`–`0x083` | Boot-time ANNOUNCE, ASSIGN, ACK, REJOIN (node identified by MAC in data) |
| Commands         | `0x100`–`0x1FF` | Base → node (`0x100` = all nodes)                                        |
| Heartbeat/status | `0x200`–`0x2FF` | Node → base periodic status                                              |
| Events           | `0x300`–`0x3FF` | Node → base immediate events                                             |
| Reserved         | everything else | Unused in v1 (~1276 IDs, including `0x400`–`0x7FF`)                      |


Each assigned node consumes **3 operational IDs** — command, heartbeat, and event. With
N nodes: **3×N + 4 discovery + 1 broadcast** (e.g. node 4 → `0x104`, `0x204`, `0x304`).
Maximum **255 nodes** (`nodeId` 1…255). About **772 IDs** are allocated by design; the
rest of the 11-bit space is free for future message types.

## Synchronization strategy

Synchronization is owned by the base station. The three BNC connectors handle all
timing I/O between the platform and external recording systems:


| Connector | Direction               | Purpose                          |
| --------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| BNC In 1  | External → Base station | External trigger or clock input  |
| BNC In 2  | External → Base station | Secondary external input         |
| BNC Out   | Base station → External | Platform event or trigger output |


BNC signals run on an isolated 5 V rail to minimise ground loops and noise coupling to
electrophysiology systems. Detailed signal levels, edge timing, polarity, jitter
budget, and recording system compatibility targets are captured in
`[sync-and-recording.md](sync-and-recording.md)`.

## Status indicators

### Module LEDs

Each module carries three LEDs (red, green, yellow):


| LED           | Placement     | Notes                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Status LED    | Upward-facing | Visible from above during experiments |
| General LED 1 | On-board      | User configurable                     |
| General LED 2 | On-board      | User configurable                     |


State assignments (boot, fault, active, reward, idle, etc.) are not yet finalised.
See `[failure-modes.md](failure-modes.md)` for fault code cross-reference.

| User-configurable | 2     | General status                              |
| BNC indicator     | 3     | One per BNC channel — shows signal activity |


## Power


| Parameter                     | Value                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Module supply voltage         | 12 V                                  |
| Distribution                  | Daisy-chained through RJ45 connectors |
| Per-module worst-case current | ~450 mA                               |
| 9-module total                | ~4 A                                  |
| Recommended supply rating     | 8 A (supports up to ~16 modules)      |
| Base station supply           | USB-C (independent of module rail)    |


A single 8 A 12 V supply is the minimum recommended for a full 9-module deployment.
Scaling to 16 modules remains within the same supply rating at this per-module budget.
